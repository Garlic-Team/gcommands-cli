## 🐢 | Informations
This CLI is used for easier creation of projects that use GCommands. The CLI allows you to create a base template for a bot, a template for a plugin, and we are planning much more.  
If you want to use this CLI, take a look at our [guide](https://garlic-team.js.org/guide/cli/how-to-use-cli.html).
